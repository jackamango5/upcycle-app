    This app was created to explore the question:  
    **‚ÄúHow can I design something that encourages people to start upcycling in creative ways?‚Äù**

    ‚ôªÔ∏è **Purpose:**  
    The goal of this app is to spark ideas and curiosity. By organizing creative reuse projects by material, users can instantly find ways to turn old or unused items into useful, fun, or artistic creations.

    üí° **How It Encourages Upcycling:**
    - It lowers the barrier to entry: you just pick a material you already have.
    - It inspires creativity through diverse, easy-to-understand ideas.
    - It lets users share their own upcycling projects ‚Äî making it feel more like a community.
    - It keeps the experience simple, engaging, and focused on action ‚Äî helping users go from idea to project quickly.

    üå± Whether you're a beginner or already into DIY, this app encourages everyone to take small steps toward reducing waste and making something meaningful.
